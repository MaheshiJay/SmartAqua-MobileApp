# SmartAqua-MobileApp

The culmination of my final year research project is the development of a Smart Aqua mobile app designed to revolutionize aquarium practices. This innovative application encompasses four critical areas aimed at enhancing the overall management of aquariums: fish identification, disease identification, water quality monitoring, and fish growth measurement. Leveraging advanced image processing techniques, the app facilitates precise fish identification and disease detection, contributing to timely and accurate interventions for the well-being of aquatic inhabitants. Additionally, the incorporation of IoT technology and machine learning algorithms enables real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality parameters, ensuring a conducive environment for aquatic life. The app's comprehensive approach, merging cutting-edge technologies, promises to significantly elevate the standards of aquarium maintenance and foster a healthier and more sustainable aquatic ecosystem.
