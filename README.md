# SmartAqua-MobileApp

The culmination of my final year research project is the development of a Smart Aqua mobile app designed to revolutionize aquarium practices. This innovative application encompasses four critical areas aimed at enhancing the overall management of aquariums: 
        1. [Fish identification]
        2. [Disease identification]
        3. [Water quality monitoring]
        4. [Fish growth measurement]
 Leveraging advanced image processing techniques, the app facilitates precise fish identification, disease detection and growth measurement, contributing to timely and accurate interventions for the well-being of aquatic inhabitants. Additionally, the incorporation of IoT technology and machine learning algorithms enables real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality parameters, ensuring a conducive environment for aquatic life. The app's comprehensive approach, merging cutting-edge technologies, promises to significantly elevate the standards of aquarium maintenance and foster a healthier and more sustainable aquatic ecosystem.
